# c-forth
FORTH interpreter written entirely in portable C and FORTH. Written by Allan Pratt; completed April 1985. It implements Fig-Forth standard from 1979. For now that project has only historical interest. It shows how to bootstrap Forth system from scratch. Probably, this was the first Forth system coded entirely in C.

I've accidentally found the source code on the Internet and decided to resuscitate the project. It was written in old K&R-C. After some refactoring, reformatting and fixing obvious inconsistencies, I was able to build the interpreter with Visual Studio, targetting 64-bit Windows platform. The interpreter itself works as 16-bit.

The original source code is stored in src folder.
